Sample Script #8 - Condition String and receive()

 * In this script, we will take a look at how to receive packets using condition strings
 * Condition strings are not normal strings
 * They are written like normal strings, prefixed with a 'c'
 * They are actually stream variables, represented in the form of strings
 * Condition Strings are used to receive desired packets with specific fields and values
 * This helps in simplifying the user-side complexity in receiving and processing packets

NOTE: When this script is run, it will wait indefinitely for the packet specified in the condition string.
      So try to run a script that sends the packet, as specified in the condition string.
      ding /scripts/send_IP4.ding

.decl:
  stream cond_str

.func:
  !!! Block in which user defined functions are written
  !!! User Defined Function feature is not yet developed/implemented
  !!! Any Code inside this block will be ignored by the interpreter

.flow:
  cond_str = c"ETHER(SRC_MAC = 11~22~33~44~55~66, TYPE = 2048:2B, DEST_MAC = ff~dd~ee~cc~bb~aa) | IP4(DEST_IP = 251.250.249.248, PROTOCOL = 17:1B)"

  ! Condition Strings are specified as similar to normal strings, prefixed with a 'c'
  ! Packets in Condition String are in bottom-to-top order of the OSI layers (datalink, network, transport)
  ! Packet Names and Member Names must be specified as per ding naming convention
  ! Member values can be raw values or already declared variable

  print(cond_str)

  print("Waiting for the packet to be received...")

  print(receive(cond_str))

  print("Packet Received...")
