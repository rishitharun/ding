Sample Script #4.2 - In-built functions

 * In this script, we will use some of the in-built functions
 * We will be trying out interface(), container(), send(), receive()

.decl:
  packet test_packet

.func:
  !!! Block in which user defined functions are written
  !!! User Defined Function feature is not yet developed/implemented
  !!! Any Code inside this block will be ignored by the interpreter

.flow:

  interface("lo")

  ! interface() function is used to specify the interface on which we will be sending our packets through
  ! It is mandatory to set interface before sending any packets

  test_packet = container("ETHER")

  ! container() function will create an empty packet structure, for the packet specified in the argument
  ! The empty packet structure can be used to build the packet with the values that we desire

  test_packet.DEST_MAC = xcafebabef00d
  test_packet.SRC_MAC = xcafebabef00d
  test_packet.PAYLOAD = "Hello World !"

  send(test_packet)

  ! send() function sends the packets, specified as the arguments

  print(receive())

  ! receive() function will receive packets
  ! An optional and interesting argument can be passed to receive function
  ! The argument will be a condition string, and will be discussed later
