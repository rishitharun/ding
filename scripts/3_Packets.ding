Sample Script #3 - Packets

 * In this script, we will declare a packet variable
 * We will assign values to the members of the packet

.decl:
  packet my_packet       ! A packet is declared

  mac dest_mac, src_mac     ! mac variables for members
  number ether_type, crc    ! number variables for members
  string str_payload      ! string variable for payload

.func:
  !!! Block in which user defined functions are written
  !!! User Defined Function feature is not yet developed/implemented
  !!! Any Code inside this block will be ignored by the interpreter

.flow:
  my_packet = container("ETHER")

  ! Empty Ether container for the packet is created
  ! The packet structure has been defined to be Ether
  
  ! To find out the name of the packets as defined in ding, use pacman.py

  dest_mac = ff~dd~ee~cc~bb~aa
  src_mac = 11~22~33~44~55~66
  ether_type = 2048:2B
  crc=1:4B

  str_payload = "Hello World !"

  ! variables for members are defined with respective values

  my_packet.DEST_MAC = dest_mac
  my_packet.SRC_MAC = src_mac
  my_packet.TYPE = ether_type
  my_packet.CRC = crc

  my_packet.PAYLOAD = str_payload

  ! Ether Packet has been defined

  ! To find out the name of the members as defined in ding, use pacman.py

  ! All member variables have been assigned values
