Sample Script to send an ICMP PACKET

 * You can check the ICMP Packet in Wireshark

.decl:
  packet IP4, ETH, ICMP           ! ICMP, IP4 and Ether packets are declared

.func:
  ! Block in which user defined functions are written
  ! User Defined Function feature is not yet developed/implemented
  ! Any Code inside this block will be ignored by the interpreter

.flow:
  ETH = container("ETHER")
  IP4 = container("IP4")
  ICMP = container("ICMP")

  ! Empty Containers for the packets are created
  ! The packet structures have been defined

  ICMP.TYPE = 13:1B
  ICMP.CODE = 0:1B
  ICMP.DATA = 0:1:0:2

  ! ICMP Packet has been defined

  IP4.VERSION = 4:4b
  IP4.HEADER_LEN = 5:4b
  IP4.TYPE_OF_SERVICE =12:1B
  IP4.TOTAL_LEN =40:2B
  IP4.IDENTIFICATION=300:2B

  IP4.FLAGS = 0:3b
  IP4.FRAG_OFFSET = 0:13b

  IP4.TTL= 200:1B
  IP4.PROTOCOL = 1:1B
  IP4.SRC_IP = 255.254.253.252
  IP4.DEST_IP = 251.250.249.248

  ! IP4 Packet has been defined

  ETH.DEST_MAC = ff~dd~ee~cc~bb~aa
  ETH.SRC_MAC = 11~22~33~44~55~66
  ETH.TYPE = 2048:2B

  ! Ether Packet has been defined

  ICMP.PAYLOAD = x010203040506070809101112
  ICMP.CHECKSUM = checksum(ICMP)
  IP4.PAYLOAD = ICMP
  IP4.CHECKSUM = checksum(IP4)
  ETH.PAYLOAD = IP4

  ! ICMP Packet is made as the IP4 Packet's payload
  ! IP4 Packet is made as the Ether Packet's payload

  interface("lo")
 
  ! Loopback interface is selected

  send(ETH)   ! Sending the Packet

  print("ICMP Packet Sent Successfully")
